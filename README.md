# Dual-Quaternions
A comprehensive device (CUDA) compatible implementation of Dual-Quaternions mathematic tool used in dual-quaternion skining


I am usigin this library for warping deformatgion in a non-rigid ICP pipe-line, as long as I couldn't find a proper one I wrote it myself whcih at least everything is clear and simple for me. Also hope to be beneficial for you. 

maybe in future I wrote an comprehensive explanation about the mathematics related to Dual-Quaternions too. lets see...

If you liked it follow my projects and give me your feedback, will be happy to hear from you.
